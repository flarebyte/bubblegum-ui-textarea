# Internationalization

-   We should support more than the English language, and we could start by
    supporting the [languages that are used on the
    internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_used_on_the_Internet).
-   We need to keep an eye on performances, and be mindful before
    supporting more languages. If it appears that would need to support
    more than 30 languages, we should look at alternative ways of providing
    these customizations.
